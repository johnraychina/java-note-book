redis 集群本身支持数据重新分片，redis集群的重新分片操作是由redis的集群管理软件redis-trib负责执行的。

redis 分片依靠手动调整 node 的 slot[0~16383]来做重新分片。

例如，将部分slot从 nodeA -> 迁移到 nodeB

1. 如果请求到了nodeA，会先判断key是否在nodeA
    - 如果找到，直接返回客户端。

2. 如果没找到，返回一个ASK响应给客户端，引导客户端重定向到新的nodeB节点。

3. 客户端转向nodeB，首先发送ASKING命令，然后再次发送想要执行的key相关的命令。

如果直接发送想要执行的key相关的命令，nodeB此时并不处理，因为key所在的槽还未迁移完，槽还属于node3，会返回错误给客户端。   
但如果先发送ASKING命令，nodeB在执行key相关的命令时，不仅会检查key所属槽是否属于自己，还会检查migration_slots_to数组（正在迁往自己的槽），
判断key相关的槽是否正在迁往自己，如果是的话，则执行key相关的命令。

### 如何迁移

1. Set the destination node slot to importing state using CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> IMPORTING <source-node-id>.

2. Set the source node slot to migrating state using CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> MIGRATING <destination-node-id>.

3. Get keys from the source node with CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT command and move them into the destination node using the MIGRATE command.

4. Use CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> NODE <destination-node-id> in the source or destination.

注意：
第一步和第二部顺序不能错，我们希望目标节点可以处理ASK请求，然后再开始迁移。
第四部技术上是会在redis自动传播机制下自动实现的，但是你可以手工加快这个过程。

### 命令说明
CLUSTER SETSLOT slot IMPORTING|MIGRATING|STABLE|NODE [node-id]

1. MIGRATING 转出
CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> MIGRATING <destination-node-id>

This subcommand sets a slot to migrating state. In order to set a slot in this state, the node receiving the command must be the hash slot owner, otherwise an error is returned.

When a slot is set in migrating state, the node changes behavior in the following way:

If a command is received about an existing key, the command is processed as usually.
If a command is received about a key that does not exists, an ASK redirection is emitted by the node, asking the client to retry only that specific query into destination-node. In this case the client should not update its hash slot to node mapping.
If the command contains multiple keys, in case none exist, the behavior is the same as point 2, if all exist, it is the same as point 1, however if only a partial number of keys exist, the command emits a TRYAGAIN error in order for the keys interested to finish being migrated to the target node, so that the multi keys command can be executed.

2. IMPORTING 导入
CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> IMPORTING <source-node-id>

This subcommand is the reverse of MIGRATING, and prepares the destination node to import keys from the specified source node. The command only works if the node is not already owner of the specified hash slot.

When a slot is set in importing state, the node changes behavior in the following way:

Commands about this hash slot are refused and a MOVED redirection is generated as usually, but in the case the command follows an ASKING command, in this case the command is executed.
In this way when a node in migrating state generates an ASK redirection, the client contacts the target node, sends ASKING, and immediately after sends the command. This way commands about non-existing keys in the old node or keys already migrated to the target node are executed in the target node, so that:

New keys are always created in the target node. During a hash slot migration we'll have to move only old keys, not new ones.
Commands about keys already migrated are correctly processed in the context of the node which is the target of the migration, the new hash slot owner, in order to guarantee consistency.
Without ASKING the behavior is the same as usually. This guarantees that clients with a broken hash slots mapping will not write for error in the target node, creating a new version of a key that has yet to be migrated.

3. CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> STABLE 解决僵持问题

This subcommand just clears migrating / importing state from the slot. It is mainly used to fix a cluster stuck in a wrong state by redis-trib fix. Normally the two states are cleared automatically at the end of the migration using the SETSLOT ... NODE ... subcommand as explained in the next section.
